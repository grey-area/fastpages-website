I'm currently a machine learning R & D engineer at [vTime Limited](https://vtime.net/).

Previously, I was a research associate at the University of Manchester, working on the LAMBDA project under [Gavin Brown](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~gbrown), studying ensemble methods in deep learning. I also worked on the [PAMELA project](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/PAMELA), working on the efficient integration of semantic segmentation into [SLAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) (simultaneous localisation and mapping) systems.

I use my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/AndrewM_Webb) to share maths and science animations and visualizations.
I maintain [QCircuits]({{site.baseurl}}/qcircuits/index.html) ((<a href="https://github.com/grey-area/qcircuits" target="_blank"><img src={{site.baseurl}}/images/github.png style="border:0;" height="15" width="15"></a>), a Python package for simulating the execution of algorithms on small-scale quantum computers.
