I'm currently a machine learning R & D engineer at [vTime Limited](https://vtime.net/).

Previously, I was a research associate at the University of Manchester, working on the LAMBDA project under [Gavin Brown](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~gbrown), studying methods of training deep neural network ensembles for regression and classification that reward model diversity. I also worked on the [PAMELA project](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/PAMELA), working on the efficient integration of semantic segmentation into state-of-the-art [SLAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) (simultaneous localisation and mapping) systems.

I use my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/AndrewM_Webb) to share maths and science animations and visualizations.

I maintain [QCircuits]({{site.baseurl}}/qcircuits/index.html) ([![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/github.png)](https://github.com/grey-area/qcircuits)), a Python package for simulating the execution of algorithms on small-scale quantum computers.
